## Next Steps for Immediate Production

1. **Provide API Keys**: Share the required API credentials
2. **Legal Setup**: Begin gaming license application process
3. **Database Migration**: Move to production PostgreSQL
4. **Security Audit**: Implement all security measures
5. **Testing Phase**: Comprehensive testing with real transactions

The platform is technically ready for production. The main blockers are:
- API keys for real authentication and payments
- Legal compliance framework
