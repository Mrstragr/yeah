## What is Aviator Online?

Aviator is a popular online casino game that perfectly combines the simplicity of controls, dynamic gameplay, and sky-high rewards. In fact, it is a multiplayer game where you bet on the growing curve that is represented by a red aircraft. When the round starts, it takes off and starts to fly on the playing field.

Keep in mind that the win odds constantly grow as the aircraft gains altitude. The main aim of a player is to withdraw the bet before the plane flies away. The bet you cash out is multiplied by the odds at which you withdraw the stake. The main challenge is that you never know when the round ends.

The multiplier may reach x100+ as well as x1.01 after the round only starts. However, in most cases, the plane takes off, and players experience at least **1.05** multiplier values. If you can not cash out the bet until the plane flies away, you lose the coefficient as well as the initial sum you wager. When the round starts and a plane takes off, the winning odds begin at x1. Using handy and intuitively understandable controls, you select the bet sum to place during the pause between rounds.

Usually, it takes about five seconds. Also, you may choose to place two independent bets and increase the probability of a win. As a rule, the betting range starts at **$1** (83 INR) and ends at about **$7,000**(583,583 INR). It is important to always check betting options before signing up, as it varies from one casino to another.

Another Aviator’s feature to consider is randomness. This is what makes this game appealing to a wide audience of gamblers. The game algorithms utilize a random number generator to determine the point at which the round will end. Thus, it is impossible to predict the outcome correctly. Also, when playing the Aviator game online, the Provably Fair algorithm makes it impossible to impact the round outcome.

This option adds credibility to the game and makes it safe to play. While playing Aviator, you should remember that its theoretical average RTP is 97%. Given the game’s random nature, this value is considered high. All payouts that include fractional payments are automatically rounded down to 2 decimal places.

To make the gameplay more enjoyable, developers implemented automated betting and withdrawals. For example, you can set up the sum that will be placed as a bet before every next round. Also, you can activate an Auto Cashout mode and set up Aviator’s algorithms to cash out the stake when the multiplier reaches a specific value.

You can always communicate with other players thanks to the in-game chat or check round history and enhance your gaming experience. However, you should never rely on the statistics. Remember that it is a random game when a losing streak may quickly replace a sky-high multiplier from the previous round! Finally, Aviator is popular among gamblers for its high theoretical maximum win. Lucky players may get an **x1,000,000** multiplier per round! Of course, this is more like an exception, and you should never wait for this value, especially if you have a limited budget.

### The Mechanics

After you launch the Aviator game, you may enter the period when the previous round has not yet ended. In this case, you need to wait until the aircraft crashes and then place a bet during the five-minute pause. For this purpose, you need to type the sum you want within the available range and click the “Bet” button.

Not sure about the bet and want to insure it? Then, place one more bet, and you can further cash out independently. After the round starts, click the “ **Cash Out**” button at a moment you consider appropriate.

Don’t want to type in the stake sum every time before the round starts, or maybe it is inconvenient for you to decide at which multiplier to cash out? Then the Auto mode is what you really need. To activate this option, click the “Auto” buttons. Next, select the “Auto Play” option and customize the settings. In the table, you can select from 10 to 100 rounds and activate/deactivate the following options:

- Stop if cash decreases by a specific sum (choose the sum);
- Stop if cash increases by a specific sum (select the amount);
- Stop if the single win exceeds a specific sum (choose the sum).

Next, click “Start” or “Reset” (if you want to change settings). To activate an Auto Cash Out option, you should first click on the “Auto” button. After that, you see a toggle you can either activate or deactivate. If you activate it, you need to specify the multiplier value at which your stake must be withdrawn. The maximum possible coefficient here is capped at **x100**. Along with the main controls, there is a side menu with other participants and their winnings. You can navigate these statistics by switching between “All Bets”, “My Bets”, and “Top” options. In the upper right corner, there is a hamburger menu that allows you to set up animation, sound, and music. There, you can also find all the information about the main rules, available limits, and your betting history. Separately, there is a button to check the Provably Fair algorithm and see the round results.

### The Integrity

A fair play approach is one of the main features of the Aviator betting game, which makes it popular. Thanks to it, you are guaranteed to get a fully random outcome no third party can impact. Here is an algorithm that explains how it works.

1. The game server creates a **16-character** seed thanks to a powerful SHA-256 algorithm to ensure randomness.
2. The server seed is securely encrypted before the moment it becomes available for players to check.
3. After the pause between rounds begins, the inputs of the first three players are utilized to create a client-side seed.
4. At this step, both seeds are combined.
5. Now, it is time for Aviator algorithms to create a final SHA-512 hash based on combined seeds.
6. The SHA-512 hash determines the multiplier value at which the upcoming round will end.

The Provably Fair algorithm allows gamblers to check the round results. For this purpose, they can compare whether the final hash matches the initial seed values.

## Basic Terms You Need to Know

It is important to understand the basic terms you may face while playing Aviator. Such awareness will help you feel comfortable and get the maximum pleasure from the gameplay.

## How to Choose a Casino?

If you want to get the best experience playing the Aviator game, you should pick the right casino to register. Often, this may be a difficult task to accomplish because of the great variety of online gambling platforms available. Below, you can explore the main casino’s features to consider while choosing the place to play.

- **Licensing**. You should sign up only on gambling platforms that feature licenses and operate legally. You can find this info by communicating with the casino’s support service or on your own. In the second case, you may scroll down and check the site’s footer or navigate to the T&Cs page.
- **Bonus program**. Bonuses can expand your gambling opportunities, boost your chances of winning, and make your stay on the site more exciting. Always check the bonus description of the site and make sure it is clear and does not contain vague information. Each bonus must come with specific wagering requirements, an expiration date, a list of eligible games, and more. Consider casinos that offer promotions and events dedicated to Aviator.
- **Ease-of-use and UI**. The casino must be easy to navigate and simple. Thus, even a newcomer may be able to set everything up in a few minutes, sign up, and start playing. Do not underestimate the quality of the design and layout type. Pay attention to sites that support the change in dark/light mode, minimalistic design, and quick transactions between sections.
- **Security measures**. While playing Aviator live, you should be 100% sure that your sensitive data is reliably protected. Thus, you should check that the platform supports SSL encryption, firewalls, and ongoing fraudulent activity monitoring.
- **Reputation**. It is important to check the site’s reputation and read customer reviews. Only independent platforms, including Askgamblers or Trustpilot, can be used for this purpose.
- **Banking methods**. If you are going to play for real money, you should check the supported banking methods. Ensure your funds will be transferred to the casino balance (or withdrawn) in a secure environment. Pay attention to platforms that focus on local payment methods, such as PhonePe, UPI, etc. While checking this feature, consider potential fees and transaction time.

Finally, you should always consider the quality of customer support service. There is a low chance that you will experience problems, as most modern casinos are reliable and intuitively understandable.

However, it would not hurt if you could expect quick and highly professional support 24/7. For this purpose, you should contact the casino’s experts and ask them about functionality, available bonuses, conditions for specific regions, and more. Check the response time, behavior, and the quality of the reply.

## Differences Between Aviator Game in Different Casinos

Although Aviator has only one variation developed by Spribe, you may encounter peculiarities while playing it in different casinos. At the same time, the core mechanics of the game remained the same.

- **Bet limits and multipliers**. Casinos try to cater to the players with different risk appetites. Thus, you may find platforms that allow betting up to **$15,000** (1,249,743 INR) per round, while others cap this sum at **$100** (8,331 INR).
