# PRODUCTION SETUP GUIDE - IMMEDIATE DEPLOYMENT

## üö® CRITICAL FIXES NEEDED FOR PRODUCTION

### 1. **STOP API FLOODING - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**
**Current Issue**: 1000+ API calls per minute killing server
**Impact**: High server costs, poor performance, potential crashes
**Solution**: Already implementing smart caching hook

### 2. **REAL AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM**
**Current Issue**: Demo authentication only
**Required**: Complete phone OTP + email verification system

### 3. **REAL PAYMENT INTEGRATION**  
**Current Issue**: Mock payments
**Required**: Full Razorpay integration with real money transactions

### 4. **ERROR BOUNDARY PROTECTION**
**Current Issue**: App crashes on errors

# Need these from user:
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=<your_twilio_sid>
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=<your_twilio_token>  
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=<your_twilio_phone>
SENDGRID_API_KEY=<your_sendgrid_key>
```

### Phase 3: Real Payments (Required API Keys)
```bash
# Need these from user:
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=<already_have>
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=<already_have>
```

### Phase 4: Database Setup
```bash
# Already have PostgreSQL configured
DATABASE_URL=<already_configured>
```
